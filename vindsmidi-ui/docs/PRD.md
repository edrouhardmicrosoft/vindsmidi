# Product Requirements Document: Fluent UI + Tailwind CSS 4.0 Integration

## 1. Core Functionality & Purpose

The Fluent UI + Tailwind CSS 4.0 integration library solves the problem of combining Fluent UI's accessibility features with Tailwind CSS's styling flexibility. This new approach enables developers to create accessible, visually consistent UI components without the complexity and specificity conflicts of the current implementation.

Core functionality includes:
- Extracting accessibility features from Fluent UI components
- Applying Tailwind CSS 4.0 styling to custom markup
- Preserving Fluent UI design tokens for visual consistency
- Providing a portable, reusable component library that can be easily shared across teams
- **NEW**: CLI tool for seamless component installation, project initialization, and configuration management

## 2. Key Technical Goals & Scope

### Technical Goals:
- Create a new architectural pattern ("Component Shell Pattern") that cleanly separates behavior from styling
- Leverage Fluent UI's accessibility hooks and utilities without inheriting its styling limitations
- Implement Tailwind CSS 4.0's performance optimizations and modern CSS features
- Ensure visual consistency with Fluent UI's design system
- Develop a portable library that requires minimal setup when integrated into new projects
- **NEW**: Build a modern CLI tool that simplifies component installation and project setup
- **NEW**: Provide an interactive developer experience comparable to industry standards (shadcn/ui, Vite, Next.js)

### Out of Scope:
- Direct styling of existing Fluent UI components with Tailwind classes
- Exact visual replication of Fluent UI's animations and advanced interaction patterns
- Supporting older browsers that don't support CSS features used by Tailwind 4.0
- Implementation of every Fluent UI component (initial focus on core components only)
- **NEW**: Visual design tool or WYSIWYG editor for component customization
- **NEW**: Automatic migration of existing Fluent UI applications (though helper tools may be provided)

## 3. User Interaction & Technical Design

### Primary Users:
- Frontend developers within the organization who need to create accessible UI components
- Design system teams maintaining consistent user interfaces across multiple projects
- Application developers who want to leverage both Fluent UI's accessibility and Tailwind's styling

### Interaction Methods:
- Component imports from a central library
- Customization through Tailwind's utility classes and configuration
- Direct application of Fluent UI design tokens through CSS variables
- Access to accessibility hooks and utilities for custom component development
- **NEW**: CLI commands for project initialization and component installation
- **NEW**: Interactive prompts for configuration and customization

### Technical Design:
The architecture follows the "Component Shell Pattern":
1. Wrapper hooks extract accessibility behavior from Fluent UI
2. Custom React components render native HTML elements
3. Tailwind CSS classes style the components according to Fluent UI's design language
4. CSS variables map Fluent UI design tokens to ensure visual consistency

**NEW - CLI Architecture:**
1. Command-based interface with intuitive subcommands (init, add, config)
2. Template-based component generation with intelligent path resolution
3. Project analysis for framework detection and configuration
4. Interactive prompts for developer-friendly experience
5. Component registry for metadata and dependency management

  **Mitigation**: Build abstractions around Tailwind-specific features to isolate potential breaking changes

- **Risk**: Design token mapping might not perfectly match Fluent UI's visual appearance
  **Mitigation**: Create side-by-side comparison tools and visual regression testing

- **Risk**: Older browser support may be required despite modern CSS features
  **Mitigation**: Explore polyfill strategies and graceful degradation patterns

- **NEW Risk**: CLI template generation may break across different project structures
  **Mitigation**: Implement robust path detection and resolution with extensive testing

- **NEW Risk**: Dependency conflicts between generated components and user projects
  **Mitigation**: Develop intelligent dependency resolution with version checking

### Major Assumptions:
- Fluent UI's hooks API is stable and will not undergo significant changes

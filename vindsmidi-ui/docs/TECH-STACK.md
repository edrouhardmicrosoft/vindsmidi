# Technology Stack: Vindsmidi UI

## 1. Project Overview & Goals

Vindsmidi UI is a component library that integrates Fluent UI's accessibility features with Tailwind CSS 4.0's styling capabilities, along with a modern CLI tool for project initialization and component installation. It implements the "Component Shell Pattern" to cleanly separate behavior from styling, enabling developers to create accessible, visually consistent UI components without the complexity of specificity conflicts.

The primary goals driving technology choices include:
- Developer experience with co-located files and intuitive patterns
- Accessibility compliance with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Styling flexibility through Tailwind CSS 4.0
- Runtime performance with minimal overhead
- Maintainability through clean architecture and separation of concerns
- Portability across projects with minimal configuration
- **NEW**: Seamless developer tooling through a modern CLI experience
- **NEW**: Framework-agnostic component generation and project setup

## 2. Core Languages & Runtimes

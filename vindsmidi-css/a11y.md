# Accessibility Guidelines for Vindsmidi UI

This document outlines comprehensive accessibility best practices based on WCAG 2.1 and WAI-ARIA standards. It serves as the definitive reference for ensuring all Vindsmidi UI components meet accessibility requirements.

## Core Accessibility Principles

1. **Perceivable**: Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
   - Provide text alternatives for non-text content
   - Provide captions and other alternatives for multimedia
   - Create content that can be presented in different ways without losing information
   - Make it easier for users to see and hear content

2. **Operable**: User interface components must be operable.
   - Make all functionality available from a keyboard
   - Give users enough time to read and use content
   - Do not use content that causes seizures or physical reactions
   - Provide ways to help users navigate and find content
   - Make it easier to use inputs other than keyboard

3. **Understandable**: Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable.
   - Make text readable and understandable
   - Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
   - Help users avoid and correct mistakes

4. **Robust**: Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents.
   - Maximize compatibility with current and future user tools

## WCAG 2.1 Compliance Requirements

All Vindsmidi UI components must meet at least WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance. This includes:

### 1. Text Alternatives (1.1)
- All non-text content (icons, images) needs a text alternative
- Decorative elements should be properly hidden from assistive technology

### 2. Time-based Media (1.2)
- Provide captions and transcripts where applicable
- Include audio descriptions for video content

### 3. Adaptable Content (1.3)
- Information and structure must be programmatically determinable
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA when needed
- Ensure a meaningful sequence of content
- Make instructions not rely solely on sensory characteristics

### 4. Distinguishable Content (1.4)
- Maintain minimum contrast ratios:
  - 4.5:1 for normal text
  - 3:1 for large text (18pt or 14pt bold)
  - 3:1 for graphic elements and user interface components
- Ensure text can be resized up to 200% without loss of content or functionality
- Do not use images of text
- Support reflow (responsive design)
- Implement non-text contrast for user interface components
- Support text spacing adjustments
- Ensure content on hover/focus can be dismissed, hovered, and persistent

### 5. Keyboard Accessible (2.1)
- Make all functionality available via keyboard
- Avoid keyboard traps
- Provide shortcut key functionality
- Ensure character key shortcuts can be turned off or remapped

### 6. Enough Time (2.2)
- Provide user control for timing adjustments
- Allow pausing, stopping, or hiding content that moves or updates

### 7. Seizures and Physical Reactions (2.3)
- Nothing should flash more than three times per second

### 8. Navigable (2.4)
- Provide meaningful page titles
- Implement proper heading structure
- Make focus order logical and intuitive
- Ensure link purpose is clear
- Provide multiple ways to locate content

- Ensure target sizes are large enough (minimum 44x44px)
- Provide alternatives for motion-based interactions
- Ensure UI components maintain their state during user interaction

### 10. Readable (3.1)
- Identify the language of the page and any language changes
- Define unusual words and abbreviations

### 11. Predictable (3.2)
- Make components behave consistently and predictably
- Warn users about context changes
- Ensure consistent navigation and identification

### 12. Input Assistance (3.3)
- Identify and describe errors
- Provide labels and instructions
- Implement error prevention for legal, financial, and data submissions

### 13. Compatible (4.1)
- Ensure proper markup parsing
- Maintain name, role, value for all user interface components
- Ensure status messages can be programmatically determined

## WAI-ARIA Implementation Guidelines

ARIA should be used to enhance accessibility when native HTML is insufficient, following these principles:

1. **Use native HTML elements whenever possible**
2. **Only use ARIA when necessary**
3. **Do not change native semantics unless absolutely necessary**
4. **Always support keyboard navigation**
5. **Never suppress the focus indicator**

### ARIA Roles, Properties, and States

The following ARIA roles and attributes are commonly used in Vindsmidi UI components:

#### Common ARIA Roles

- **alert**: For notifying users about important, time-sensitive information
- **button**: For clickable elements that trigger actions
- **dialog**: For modal windows requiring user interaction
- **tablist/tab/tabpanel**: For tabbed interface components
- **menu/menuitem**: For dropdown and context menus
- **progressbar**: For loading or process indicators
- **checkbox/radio**: For selection controls
- **combobox**: For input fields with associated listbox

#### Common ARIA States and Properties

These are already defined in our `AriaProps` interface (see `components/ui/types.ts`):

```typescript
export interface AriaProps {
  'aria-controls'?: string;    // Identifies the element controlled by this one
  'aria-expanded'?: boolean;   // Indicates if a component is expanded or collapsed
  'aria-pressed'?: boolean;    // Indicates toggle button state
  'aria-selected'?: boolean;   // Indicates selection state
  'aria-label'?: string;       // Provides accessible name when no visible text is available
  'aria-describedby'?: string; // References another element providing additional description
}
```

Additional essential ARIA properties to use where appropriate:

```typescript
// Additional ARIA attributes to use where appropriate
'aria-hidden'?: boolean;      // Hides elements from assistive technology
'aria-disabled'?: boolean;    // Indicates an interactive element is disabled
'aria-haspopup'?: boolean | 'menu' | 'dialog'; // Indicates element triggers a popup
'aria-live'?: 'off' | 'polite' | 'assertive'; // For dynamic content updates
'aria-atomic'?: boolean;      // Whether assistive tech should present all or part of changed region
'aria-current'?: boolean | 'page' | 'step' | 'location' | 'date' | 'time'; // Indicates current item
'aria-required'?: boolean;    // Indicates a form field is required
'aria-invalid'?: boolean | 'grammar' | 'spelling'; // Indicates input error state
'aria-errormessage'?: string; // References element containing error message
```

## Component-Specific Best Practices

### Buttons
- Always have an accessible name (via text content or aria-label)
- Use native `<button>` elements when possible
- If using custom buttons, ensure proper focus management and keyboard events
- Maintain proper focus states with sufficient contrast

### Inputs and Form Controls
- Always use proper labels (with `<label>` elements)
- Use fieldsets and legends for grouping related controls
- Provide clear error messaging with aria-invalid and aria-errormessage
- Ensure validation errors are programmatically associated with inputs

### Modals/Dialogs
- Trap focus within the dialog when open
- Return focus to triggering element when closed
- Use proper aria-modal="true" and role="dialog"
- Provide a visible and accessible close mechanism

### Navigation
- Use proper landmark roles
- Ensure current page/section is indicated (aria-current)
- Provide skip links for keyboard users
- Ensure dropdown navigation is keyboard accessible

### Tabs
- Follow proper tablist/tab/tabpanel pattern
- Use aria-selected for the active tab
- Ensure tab panel is properly referenced by aria-controls

### Accordions
- Use appropriate heading levels in a logical hierarchy
- Properly communicate expanded/collapsed state
- Allow keyboard users to expand/collapse panels

### Tables
- Use proper table markup with headers and captions
- Associate headers with cells for complex tables
- Ensure responsive tables maintain data relationships

### Tooltip/Popover
- Ensure tooltips are accessible via keyboard
- Use aria-describedby to associate tooltip content with trigger
- Make tooltips dismissible and persistent when triggered

### Alerts and Notifications
- Use aria-live regions with appropriate politeness levels
- Make notifications time-persistent for screen reader users
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for alert states

## Testing Accessibility

Every component should be tested for accessibility:

1. **Keyboard Testing**
   - Can you reach all interactive elements with Tab key?
   - Can you activate all controls with Enter or Space?
   - Are custom keyboard interactions documented and consistent?

2. **Screen Reader Testing**
   - Test with at least one screen reader (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Verify appropriate announcements happen for state changes
   - Ensure all content is accessible via screen reader

3. **Contrast Testing**
   - Test all text and UI components for sufficient contrast
   - Verify focus indicators have sufficient contrast
   - Check contrast in all states (hover, active, disabled)

4. **Responsive Testing**
   - Verify components work at 200% zoom
   - Test behavior at different viewport sizes
   - Confirm touch targets are large enough

## Conclusion

Accessibility is not a checklist but a continuous commitment to inclusive design. By following these guidelines and incorporating accessibility from the beginning of component development, we ensure that Vindsmidi UI components are usable by the widest range of users possible.

Remember: No ARIA is better than bad ARIA. Always start with semantic HTML and only add ARIA when necessary to enhance accessibility.
